Theory - Adapter Design Pattern
Imagine an adapter : sits between two interface to help them communicate each other.
Example : Phone ka adapter - converts AC - DC

Similarly whenever you need to communicate with third party applications, always go for Adapter design pattern.
Don't make your code tightly coupled with third party. Always use an extra layer which will communicate with third party applications.
Always keep your code loosely coupled with third party applications.
